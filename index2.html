            <p>This is my family. I love every single one of them. We don't always understand each other, but we still care about each other. We all face difficulties, so the only thing I pray for my family is that we overcome all difficulties and that our Lord will always guide them and provide them with good health. I hope that someday I will be able to fulfill their dreams for them, and I will work hard to finish my studies and graduate for my family.</p>

            <p>My journey through college was not an easy one for me. First and foremost, because our classes are only available online, our setup was challenging. Second, our financial means, specifically for laboratories and other expenses for other uses. It was draining physically and mentally, especially after the other activities followed by homework, which was not easy for me as a college student. But the good thing about this journey is that I overcame all of those difficulties and I am now a fourth-year college student. I can say that not everything is simple; everything is not easy. But one of my motivations is to simply trust the Lord in the plans he has for us because I know that all of the trials he has in keep for us, will not be given if we are unable to face them. My family became my motivation to keep going because they have been my inspiration throughout my life and have also served as a guide for me to enter this phase of my life. I have many people to thank, especially the Lord, who gave me the strength and wisdom to accomplish all of this. The only thing I can say is that we should always do our best and strive to get closer to our goals. The only thing I can say is that we should always do our best and get closer to him in order to stay on track.</p

    <p>My long-term goal after graduation is to start a food business or a family business to generate income. This is a way I know will help my family, especially since my mother is working in another country, and I hope that someday I will be able to help them and they will be able to relax in their lives.</p>

        <p>One of my dreams for my parents is to travel with them on trips to different countries. I want to give them that chance because I know it will make them happy. I want our entire family to travel across the country and take pictures to create memories.</p>
